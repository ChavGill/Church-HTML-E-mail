# Church-HTML-E-mail


A project for my church (and current employer). I wanted to put the skills I've been learning to practical use and being able to collab them with a project for an organization I am passionate about is a bonus on this tech journey.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, Inline CSS, Netlify Hosting

## Optimizations

I originally made it to fit laptop spces but knew I had to make it responsive. Also wanted to make it deliverable so I added all the external links and embedded the video.

## Takeways/New Lessons

My e-mail account is flooded with e-mails daily. It is cool to be able to create the content I see every day and know that so many companies utilize projects like this.
